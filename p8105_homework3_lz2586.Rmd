```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
options(tibble.print_min = 5)


```


```{r}





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
